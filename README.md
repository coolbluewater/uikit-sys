# uikit-sys - Rust bindings to to iOS UIKit Objective-C framework

[![Build Status](https://github.com/simlay/uikit-sys/workflows/Rust/badge.svg)](https://github.com/simlay/uikit-sys/actions)

## Why?
Because there needs to exist some bindings to the iOS framework. This is the
most complete bindgen of the docs as it uses all of the objective-c features in
rust-bindgen.

## How do I use this?
`cargo doc --open --target aarch64-apple-ios` and then read the docs.
Admittedly, it would be nice if the docs had links to the original apple docs
but that's actually kind of hard to do.

Here are the docs: [simlay.github.io/uikit-sys](https://simlay.github.io/uikit-sys)

## Are there examples?
Maybe when I get the time.
